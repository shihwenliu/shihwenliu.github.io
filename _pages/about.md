Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at <a href='https://wustl.edu/'>Washington University in St. Louis</a>.
My research focuses in Behavioral/Experimental Economics and Microeconomic Theory. 

I am supported by <a href='https://mcdonnell.wustl.edu/'>McDonnell International Scholars Academy</a> and <a href='https://english.moe.gov.tw/mp-1.html'>Ministry of Education in Taiwan</a>.
Previously, I completed my B.A. in Economics with a minor in Mathematics at <a href='https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/'>National Taiwan University</a>.

Feel free to email me at shih-wen.liu[at]wustl.edu.
